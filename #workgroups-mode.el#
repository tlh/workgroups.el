;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   workgroups-mode.el is a window configuration persistence minor
;;   mode for GNU Emacs.  It allows you to persist window
;;   configurations, called "workgroups" because it's shorter and
;;   funnier, between sessions.  workgroups-mode saves the window
;;   layout of the current frame, as well as each window's buffer's
;;   filename if it's visiting a file, or its buffername otherwise.
;;   And that's it. It doesn't try to save complicated information
;;   about the buffer, like major or minor modes.  If you save
;;   workgroups that include things like erc or gnus buffers, you
;;   should launch those applications and buffers again in your next
;;   session before restoring the workgroup that includes
;;   them. Nothing bad will happen otherwise, of course.
;;   workgroups-mode will just default to a buffer that already
;;   exists, like *scratch*.
;;
;;   `workgroups-list' contains all the currently available
;;   workgroups.  You can switch to workgroups (i.e. restore window
;;   configurations), bury them, go to the previous or next workgroup
;;   circularly, etc.  `workgroups-save' saves `workgroups-list' to a
;;   file, which can then be loaded in another session.  Workgroups
;;   are added to `workgroups-list' by calling `workgroups-create',
;;   removed by calling `workgroups-kill', and can be moved to the end
;;   of `workgroups-list' by calling `workgroups-bury'.  In general,
;;   operations on workgroups and `workgroups-list' behave as
;;   similarly to buffers and buffer-lists as possible.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;   - Put `workgroups-mode.el' somewhere on your emacs load path
;;
;;   - Add this line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'workgroups-mode)
;;

;;; Configuration:
;;
;;   To turn on workgroups-mode, either issue the command:
;;
;;     M-x workgroups-mode
;;
;;   Or put this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (workgroups-mode t)
;;
;;   To start off, you should add a few workgroups.  When your frame
;;   is in a state that you'd like to save, run the command
;;   `workgroups-create', and give the workgroup a name when prompted.
;;   Once you've added a few workgroups with `workgroups-create', you
;;   should save them to a file with `workgroups-save'.  You can
;;   designate this file to be automatically loaded when
;;   workgroups-mode is started by setting `workgroups-default-file'
;;   like so:
;;
;;     (setq workgroups-default-file "/path/to/workgroups/file")
;;
;;   If `workgroups-autoswitch' is non-nil, the first workgroup in a
;;   file will automatically be switched to when the file is loaded:
;;
;;     (setq workgroups-autoswitch t)
;;
;;   With these two options set, workgroups mode will automatically
;;   load the default file and switch to the first workgroup in it at
;;   emacs startup.
;;
;;   Check the documentation of the customizable variables below for
;;   more configuration options.
;;

;;; TODO:
;;
;;  - Switch just the window structure, keeping the current buffers,
;;    as far as that is possible with mismatch.
;;
;;  - Multi-frame support. Need to update mode-line for this, too.
